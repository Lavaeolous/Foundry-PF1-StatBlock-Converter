Editor’s Note
The stats given for the gnoll indicate that it has a shield bonus to its AC, as well as listing a heavy wooden shield in the Treasure line. However, the attack line states that it is wielding a spear two-handed in melee. It is completely reasonable that gnolls use a wide variety of weapons, so here are two alternative stat block entries which allow for both situations (wielding a heavy shield or wielding a spear two-handed.) The entries below should replace those given in the original stat block at left (depending on which you choose to use).

Wielding Battleaxe plus Heavy Wooden Shield

AC As shown at left
Melee battleaxe +3 (1d8+2/x3)
Ranged longbow +1 (1d8/x3)

Wielding Spear Two-Handed:

AC 14, touch 10, flat-footed 14 (+3 armor, +1 natural)
Melee As shown at left
Treasure NPC Gear (studded leather armor, spear, other treasure)

ECOLOGY

Environment warm plains or desert
Organization solitary, pair, hunting party (2–5 gnolls and 1–2 hyenas), band (10–100 adults plus 50% noncombatant children, 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 20 adults, 1 leader of 4th–6th level, and 5–8 hyenas), or tribe (20–200 plus 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 20 adults, 1 or 2 lieutenants of 4th or 5th level, 1 leader of 6th–8th level, 7–12 hyenas, and 4–7 hyaenodons)
Treasure NPC Gear (leather armor, heavy wooden shield, battleaxe, longbow with 20 arrows, other treasure)

Gnolls are a race of hulking, humanoids that resemble hyenas in more than mere appearance; they show a striking affinity with the scavenging animals, to the point of keeping them as pets, and reflect many of the lesser creatures’ behaviors.
